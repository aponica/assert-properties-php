# @aponica/assert-properties-php

Assert that an object contains certain properties.

This is a convenient way to assert, for example, that certain parameters
or options have been provided. By default, all specified properties must
be defined (an "and" check), but it is also possible to specify that a
certain number of the possibilities are defined (an "or" check).

An equivalent JS package, @aponica/assert-properies-js, is available,
and should be kept synchronized with this version for consistency.

## Installation

```sh

```

## Usage

### Example 1: Assert All Properties ("and")

Assert the associative array passed in as the first argument includes all of 
the property names specified by the second argument:

```php
use function Aponica\AssertProperties\fAssertProperties;
try {
  fAssertProperties( [ 'b' => true, 'n' => 123.456, 'z' => 'hello' ],
    [ 'b', 'n', 'z' ] );
  }
catch ( $iEx ) {
  echo $iEx;
  }
```

### Example 2: Assert One Property ("or")

Assert the object passed in as the first argument includes only one of the
property names specified by the second argument:

```php
use function Aponica\AssertProperties\fAssertProperties;
try {
  fAssertProperties( [ 'n' => 789.10 ],
    [ 'b', 'n', 'z' ], [ 'nMax' => 1 ] );
  }
catch ( $iEx ) {
  echo $iEx;
  }
```

### Example 3: Assert Two Properties ("or") with Options

Assert the object passed in as the first argument includes any two of the
property names specified by the second argument, using a custom label in 
the error message. This example will throw an exception with the message
"`foo: too many properties`":

```php
use function Aponica\AssertProperties\fAssertProperties;
try {
  fAssertProperties( [ 'b' => true, 'n' => 123.456, 'z' => 'hello' ],
    [ 'b', 'n', 'z' ], 
    [ 'zLabel' => 'foo', 'nMax' => 2, 'nMin' => 2 ] );
  }
catch ( $iEx ) {
  echo $iEx; // foo: too many properties
  }
```

### Example 4: Deep Assertions

Assert that the object "foo" includes a property named "bar", and that "bar"
is itself an object containing only one of the properties "baz" or "qux":

```php
use function Aponica\AssertProperties\fAssertProperties;
try {
  $foo = [ 'bar' => [ 'baz' => 1, 'qux' => 2 ] ];
  fAssertProperties( $foo, [ 'bar' ], [ 'zLabel' => 'foo' ] );
  fAssertProperties( $foo[ 'bar' ], [ 'baz', 'qux' ], 
    [ 'zLabel' => 'foo[bar]', 'nMax' => 1 ] );
  }
catch ( $iEx ) {
  echo $iEx; // foo[bar]: too many properties
  }
```
